## Getting Started

To start using Shiza, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Shiza compiler can be downloaded and installed from the official website [link to be inserted].
   2. **Hello World**: Write your first Shiza program by creating a file with a `.bmx` extension, and then write the following code:

       ```shiza
           package main;

           do main[] (
                define intEr = "Hello World!";
                log `#( intEr )`;
           )
       ```

3. **Compile and Run**: Compile your Shiza program using the Shiza compiler:

    ```bash
    shiza your_program.bmx
    ```


4. **Explore Documentation**: Refer to the official Shiza documentation [link to be inserted] for more information on language features, syntax, and examples.

## Syntax Example

Here's an example of a simple "Hello, World!" program in Shiza:
